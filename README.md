## Installing

First, create the volume that Humpback Server will use to store its database:

```bash
docker volume create humpback_data
```

Then, install the Humpback Server container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name humpback-server \
  -p 8100:8100 \
  -p 8101:8101 \
  --restart=always \
  -v humpback_data:/workspace/data \
  -e LOCATION=prd \
  humpbacks/humpback-server
```

By default, Humpback Server will expose the UI over port `8100` and expose a API server over port `8101` for receiving
agent report.

Humpback Server has now been installed. you can log into your Humpback Server instance by opening a web browser and
going to:

```
http://localhost:8100
```
